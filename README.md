Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a prevalent and potentially damaging security vulnerability in
web applications. In response to this threat, researchers have proposed a novel approach
utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers for XSS detection. The
use of CNN and Transformers allows for effective modeling of the complex interactions
and patterns present in web application data, facilitating the identification of XSS attacks.
This approach leverages the capabilities of CNN to extract hierarchical features from the
input data and the attention mechanisms of Transformers to capture long-range
dependencies, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy and efficiency. By combining the
strengths of both CNN and Transformers, this method demonstrates promising results in
detecting XSS attacks in web applications. The collaborative nature of CNN and
Transformers in this context enables the detection system to learn and adapt to evolving
XSS attack patterns, thus offering an innovative and robust solution for improving web
application security. Overall, the integration of CNN and Transformers in XSS detection
presents a powerful and effective approach to safeguarding web applications against this
common cyber threat.
